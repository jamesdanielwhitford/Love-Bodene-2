---

I was on the train home when I first listened to *Cherry Blossom* by Dynasty House and it was the kind of evening where everything feels just a little out of reach. The only way I can describe the feeling is this: as if someone had cracked my ribs open and was gently tugging at my heart. A soft kind of violence. An addictive kind of melancholy.

It feels like the breath before kissing someone new. Like the night before going on a trip. It lingers on the edge of something that was, something that is, and something that will soon cease to be.

It's the album I play when I take late-night Ubers home alone and feeling broke, behind in life, and painfully small. And yet, it fills me with something vast. The hush before the rush. A tempest, transporting my mind to a magical island. A place of destiny. This album is a portal not to healing, or closure, or clarity but to something far messier. A secret sadness. A version of myself I don't always recognise. It opens a door to a quiet place where I can finally feel what I've been avoiding. A place where grief lives, and love lingers, and time blurs.

Without fail, it makes me cry. Leaves my chest tight, my hands fidgety and not knowing what to do with all the feeling. I'm still on the train, clinging to the final notes of *Punch Drunk*, wishing the song would never end. Wishing that when the carriage doors slide open, I'll step into somewhere else, a new place, a different time.

**Anywhere but here.  
Anywhere but the past.**

These songs are soaked in grief. Grief for lovers lost and versions of ourselves we'll never get back. Grief for the things we didn't say. For time that keeps going, dragging feelings with it like a tide pulling back into the ocean.

To me, grief is also losing time to daydreaming about a life I never had. A youth I didn't live. Love that never reached me. Plans never made. Regrets that bloom under fluorescent light at 1 a.m. When I listen to *Lipstick*, it makes me feel like I did the first time I heard Bowie's *Heroes*. Raw. Full of aching possibility. It's the feeling of leaning your head out a car window on an empty highway at night. Of watching a cigarette burn quietly in an ashtray, with no one around to inhale or exhale. Just embers fading into the darkness.

> A note on grief:

Today would've been my dad's birthday and I have been listening to *Cherry Blossom* once again. It's been nearly two years since he died. There are no words for that. Sometimes I think the memory isn't even mine — just a strange pain borrowed from someone else. It makes me think of the song *Severed* and the idea of being permanently cut off. A liberation from suffering as well as a world of isolation. Death is but a moment, a changing of state. But in this moment there is so much fear, like being in the dark and wanting for someone to switch a light on.

I think the biggest lesson I've learned from the idea of being "severed" is that there's no real escape, no place to run. Instead, you often find yourself trapped in a state of limbo, caught in endless circles where nothing quite moves forward. When I watched the band live for the first time, one of their songs sparked a chaotic energy. A group of boys started moshing, their bodies crashing together in a whirlwind of motion and raw emotion...

Watching that, I was struck by the paradox at the heart of the song itself. The lyrics speak of separation and loss — a sense of being cut off, isolated. Yet, when played loud and alive, it summons bodies to collide, to move, to express something primal and urgent. It's a song about being severed, but it also brings people together in an intense, visceral communion.

This album makes me confront my own mortality. What it means to change. To lose time. It wraps itself around my stress about things slipping away — the friends, the plans, the youth I can't hold onto. This EP has been my companion through rejection, through loneliness.

It's not just music. It's a secret suffering. A gut punch. A mirror. It harbours a voyeuristic quality, making me feel like I'm floating above people, watching them go about their lives. Wondering how they love, how they wash their hair, how they find comfort in this absurd world.

In all of it, it's that one song that pulls me back — *Following Me*. There is a sense of lingering with this final song and leaves you suspended in a strange and enigmatic uncertainty for the future. Some days this song can also be so incredibly overwhelming and reminds you of a past that is not so distant. This song captures that moment when you don't want to let go, but instead want to transform your feelings into something you can carry.

**Love,
